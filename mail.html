It is crucial to reiterate that the <strong>objective of this appeal is to bring to light the urgent need to rehabilitate Lakshadweep&rsquo;s ecosystem and protect the rights of the local population. The new rules do not align with these demands and should immediately be recalled for reevaluation.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Introduction of the Draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation 2021 (LDAR), along with the Draft Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation 2021, and Anti-social Activities Regulation Bill, 2021, will enforce a structural change in the administrative operations of Lakshadweep which will give control over the livelihoods (including land ownership, jobs, socio-cultural relations etc.) of islanders in a manner which is highly intrusive and appears to be in violation of the rights given to them under Scheduled Tribes (Union Territories) order, 1951.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>LDAR </strong>holds the potential of reducing the autonomy of the local people over their own land. It will not only <strong>prevent people from becoming stakeholders in their own development</strong> but also <strong>displace them from their homes</strong>. Displacement of people can lead to <strong>decreased safety and protection against climatic disasters</strong>&mdash;which have become more frequent and intense due to unchecked environmental degradation and shrinking islands. Moreover, &lsquo;developmental&rsquo; projects in the region need to be redefined from a sustainable and conservationist lens, so as to prevent these projects from causing long-term socio-ecological and economical damage.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The opening up of liquor shops in Lakshadweep under the pretext of making the island a &lsquo;tourist hub&rsquo; appears to be in contrast with the consensus that the local population has on liquor consumption.
